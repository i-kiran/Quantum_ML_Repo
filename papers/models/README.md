1. [QNN][PQC] **Quantum Self-Attention Neural Networks for Text Classification**
  - Proposes a hybrid quantum-classical approach to implementing self-attention layers.
  - Keys and query are computed using quantum ansatzes and before being projected to a classical representation to compute attention scores.
