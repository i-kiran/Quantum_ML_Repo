1. [QDL][QUL] **AI Meets Physics: A Comprehensive Survey** [@Jiao2024AIMP]
    - Surveys applications of diverse branches of physics to machine learning, including classical mechanics, stastical mechanics, electromagnetism, and quantum mechanics.
    - Includes sections on quantum machine learning (QML) and quantum deep learning
        - QML section covers both unsupervised quantum learning algorithms (Quantum K-means, Quantum PCA) and supervised algorithms (Quantum decision trees, Quantum SVMs, etc.)
        - In QDL, the paper describes larger neural networks. In general, the individual neuron building-blocks of these models map an input quantum state to an output state via a learned unitary transformation, which may then be followed by a measurement to add nonlinearity. Building upon this framing, designs for larger models such as QCNNs, QRNNs, etc. can be conceived.
